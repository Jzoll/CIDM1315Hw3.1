        Qualifications and Training
    </h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            My technical qualifications are currently somewhat lacking, but half a semester of CS classes is <i>not
                nothing!</i> In my short time at school, I've managed to learn a lot about web pages and I have tried to
            take
            advantage of the opportunity to continue learning on my own initiative. This has included learning about
            VSCode, live-server, and SVGs. I'm particularly interested in the power of SVGs and their use in data
            visualization and I would like to learn more about technologies that I can use to manipulate and enhance
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also had the good luck of knowing several professional engineers who are able to give me their
            perspectives on the work culture and expectations of software engineering. In this sense, I feel qualified
            to at least begin an internship at an engineering firm. I've also received technical advice from my friends
            and through these conversations I have gained some insight in regard to the high-level concepts that I
            will need to be familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>
            In regards to what I bring to the table I have an immense sense of <b>responsibility and follow-through</b>
            when
            assigned a task I always give it an <b>honest effort to reach its full potential</b>. My curiosity is
            <i>boundless</i> and
            I continually find new information to engage with this enables me to have increased flexibility when
            approaching tasks. In terms of experience I've made different projects such as the page you're reading now!
            Last but not least I have the <i>willingness to try and fail in order to succeed</i>. With this willingness
            I've
            been able to really grow not only my skill but as a person.
