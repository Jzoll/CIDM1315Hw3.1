        Education and Experience
    </h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            During my academic career, I've had the opportunity to earn four Associate's degrees. I studied <i>Liberal
                Arts
                and Natural and Physical Sciences in high school and Architecture and Diagnostic Medical Sonography</i>
            in
            college. I've had a longer journey than most in search of my passion and <b>I am grateful to have had so
                much
                exposure to the different paths I might take.</b> Most recently, I've begun to pursue a degree in
            Computer
            Information Systems. It's been less than a semester so far, but I feel a passion for the broad creative and
            industrial possibilities of my chosen field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite my as yet lacking experience in professional engineering, I've been lucky to have a broad scope of
            personal experiences that I believe will help me perform well in any setting. I've had the opportunity to
            travel all over the country and even visit our neighbors to the north and south. This exposure to different
            places, people, and cultures has been vital to my understanding of the world and of myself, and it has
            allowed me to collaborate effectively with all kinds of people. As a part of this exposure, I was also able
            to reconnect with my Mexican heritage and learn Spanish. Particularly in Texas, this knowledge of Spanish
            and Mexican norms will give me an edge when communicating with a diverse team of coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also been fortunate enough to pursue many creative endeavors. Each of these pursuits has taught me
            something different. Ceramics taught me the importance of perseverance in the face of failure. Dance taught
            me to express myself boldly. Yoga taught me to look inward and to be patient. Each of these skills will
            translate well to any professional environment. I believe that these experiences and skills have made me a
            more well-rounded person who will be better able to follow through on her goals and collaborate with anybody
            regardless of the challenges we face.
