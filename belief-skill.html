        Beliefs and Skill
    </h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            <b>I believe in learning</b>, both in a professional and a personal capacity. All my life, I've endeavored
            to learn
            as much as I can. I've taken dance classes and gotten certified to practice sonography. I've learned to
            express myself via ceramic, yoga, and dance, and learned how to speak with clients and patients. Learning is
            an integral part of my life and one that I hope to pursue forever, <i>in some form</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also believe in <b>kindness</b>. My work has taught me the value of empathy, and I strive every day to
            realize
            that value internally. I believe that this mindset can be an essential component of the balance between
            personal and professional life. Being conscious of the way in which your word and actions affect others is
            extremely important, especially in the workplace where it is best to keep professional and friendly
            relationships.

        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my professional and academic career, I have cultivated a set of skills that can be applied to any
            challenge I face in life. The most important of these skills is my <i>analytical and critical thinking</i>.
            Because
            of the variety of my interests, I've had to learn to think about problems in creative ways and quickly
            imagine new angles from which to tackle them. I've also come to understand my learning style and the way in
            which I study most efficiently. This allows me to dive into any subject I come across and come away with a
            good conceptual and technical understanding. I believe that these essential skills will allow me to
            <b>thrive
                in any environment</b>.
